# The "publicSourceBranch" variable is used by .NET Docker infra templates as part of the image info
# filename in dotnet/versions. This is used to cache metadata about the results of previous builds
# to allow features like skipping builds of unchanged images. So, simplify "microsoft/main" to
# "main" and "microsoft/nightly" to "nightly". For PRs, use "main" as the image info source unless
# the PR is merging into "nightly". Also handle dev branch targets.
